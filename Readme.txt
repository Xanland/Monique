Nuwani 2.0 RC1 - December 28th, 2008

After almost two years, Las Venturas Playground will stop using Delvor as their
main IRC Bot Platform. While the bot was extensively used, it lacked some
nessesary features and the performance wasn't great. Therefore was decided to
develop an entire new platform, which ended up being Nuwani v2. This new
platform would utilize a proper Object Orientated architecture, include good
documentation and feature some of the newest PHP 5.3 features around.

An overview of the features is included in the Features.txt file, and
a complete changelog of the previous versions can be found in a file called,
suprisingly, Changelog.txt. If you have any plans to work with the Nuwani
source, please read the License.txt file or, preferably, keep the following
three points in mind;

- If you re-distribute the code, you MUST release it under the LGPL license,
  meaning all source-code of your project should be included.

On top of that, please send me a note about it, as it's nice to see about
other projects using my code. Documentation is available all around the code,
and a set of HTML files will be included with the final release.

Thank you for using Nuwani 2.0,
Peter Beverloo
