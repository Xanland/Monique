NUWANI 3.0 - NO DATE SET - Peter Beverloo, MrBondt and Wesley

Nuwani 3.0 features a whole new logging-, authorization and dependency model. The exact features and
possibilities of this new major are yet undetermined.

- Branched Nuwani 2.3 for stable development, trunk now contains version 3.0 (Peter).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NUWANI 2.1 - NO DATE SET - Peter Beverloo, Jorijn, Wesley and MrBondt

The 2.1 release will mostly iron out any bugs which made it to the final release, and next to
that, add some (large) new features. Most importantly, Nuwani now allows you to have secured
connections to the IRC Servers, re-enabled signal handling for linux and supports PHP 6.

- Added an extra check for null in the socket-write method, which gave errors (Peter).
- Added a version check in the run.php file, to inform people who are not running PHP 5.3 (MrBondt).
- The onDisconnect callback now gets distributed after disconnecting the socket (Peter).
- The @ ("silent-error")-operator works again, which needed a check in the error-handler (Peter).
- Fixed directory-modules, which wouldn't load, and added the !modulelist command (Peter).
- Signal catching implemented for Linux systems, now features proper, clean shutdowns (Peter).
- Added the ability for secured connections to an IRC Server utilizing OpenSSL and streams (Peter).
- Improved the PHP version check in run.php, so people running PHP6 can use Nuwani too (Peter).
- Split up internal commands and personal commands, to ease up the updating cycle (Peter, MrBondt).
- Split up the Command module in a directory, so the Command class can have its own file (Peter).
- Fixed a number of warnings when a module could not be properly loaded (Peter).
- Added the Countable interface to BotGroup, to allow usage of count() on the class (Peter).
- Recreated all the required commands and added !restart, full list can be found below (Peter).
- A PROTOCTL command will now be send to indicate that we can receive advanced /names (Peter).
- Added a simple database class which extends MySQLi, but includes singleton (Peter).

The following internal commands have been added to the Command module for Nuwani 2.1:

!cmdadd        !cmdremove   !cmdrename   !cmdchannel   !cmdnetwork
!cmdcode       !cmdlist     !cmdlevel    !moduleload   !moduleunload
!modulereload  !modulelist  !botlist     !meminfo      !restart

NUWANI 2.0 FINAL - FEBRUARY 2nd, 2009 - Peter Beverloo, Jorijn, Wesley and MrBondt

This third Release Candidate will most likely be the last one prior to the Final release of Nuwani
2.0, a release Wesley will be helping us with. It will contain mainly bugfixes and a few
minor enhancements, to make the platform as flexible, efficient and fast as possible.
Issues and request are still welcome however!

- Added the possibility for modules to be directories, allowing cleaner architecture for larger ones (Peter).
- Moved the onRawSend callback; commands are now distributed prior to calling onRawSend (Peter).
- Implemented a number of colour- and formatting defines in the module base (Peter).
- Included a CTCP helper module, replying on the most common and required CTCP commands (Peter).
- Fixed handling of single-worded CTCP commands in the bot message analyser (Peter).
- Fixed slave- and master selection with the bot manager, due to an excess equal-mark (Jorijn).
- Fixed Socket::process () throwing an error with every loop if the connection has died (Peter).
- Added the nickname-prefix option for commands (e.g. Nuwani: !output), for multiple master bots (Wesley).
- Optimalised various bits of code for better performance and overall efficiency (Peter).
- Added various error checks for non-existing commands in the Command module, which could cause warnings (Peter).
- Disabled the Module::onRawSend callback by default, which can be enabled by a second parameter (Peter).
- Updated the commands which are included by default: !cmdadd, !cmddel, !cmdrename, !cmdlevel, !cmdchannel, !cmdnetwork (Peter).
- Added a callback for INVITE IRC-commands, also included an Invite module for auto-join (Peter).
- Added a method to get all bots in the bot-manager (BotManager :: getBotList ()) (Peter).
- Added some extra checks to the BotGroup's offsetGet and -Exists methods (Peter).
- Removed the call to Module :: shutDown (), seeing PHP supports this thing called destructors (Peter).
- Added various module commands: !moduleload, !moduleunload, !moduleunload (Peter).
- Removed runkit support for the time being, due to it being highly unstable with PHP 5.3 beta1 (Peter).
- Made the sleep-timer configurable to select various performance profiles for the bot (Peter).
- Exception handling has been fixed, and now works properly. The exception is also shown on IRC (Peter).
- Added the possibility to get the network-name from a bot using the Array-syntax (Peter).
- Some grammatical fixes in exceptions and comment, nothing major though (Peter).
- Fixed a bug in Bot :: setBotInfo (), with overwriting the network information collected (Peter).
- Added tracking of supported features of an IRC Network, testable using the new command !supports (Peter).

Release Candidate 3 should be the release package. From now on, only critical bugs will be fixed,
meaning a final 2.0 release is just a few days away.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NUWANI 2.0 Release Candidate 2 - JANUARY 23rd, 2009 - Peter Beverloo, MrBondt

The second Release Candidate contains, sadly, some new features (strictly it should be enhancements
only). Next to that, a whole list of bugs has been fixed. MrBondt and Jorijn have joined the
development team, and Wesley has contributed some code for the NetworkManager::add method.

- Fixed issue #2 with the Bot-Manager's network selection procedure.
- Added NetworkManager::add(), as provided by Wesley in issue #7.
- Added BotManager::create to create a new bot, and an alias to unregister (::destroy).
- The commands module now supports various actions using ArrayAccess.
- Bots may now be bound to a certain IP address and/or port.
- Some minor changes which will improve Slave usage- and handling.
- Fixed issue #10 with the module-callback stopping after the Evaluation module.
- Removed the onDisconnect callback from the Connection-module, as it served no purpose.
- Fixed the call to onModuleLoad in the module unload function, now points to onModuleUnload.
- Improved the Timer class with various functions to list and modify timers.
- Added an extra check to the loadModule method, to ensure we're actually loading a module.
- Added an extra check to creating a timer, squashing out yet another possible crash.
- Added a onRawSend callback for non-slave bots which distribute data or messages.
- The Commands module now supports binding a command to a certain channel.
- Re-compiled the included runkit.so file to the new Zend-API number (2009-01-15 - update your PHP!)
- Included a proper error- and exception handling, purely because it was lacking.

Small note for those who will be using this version: a bug (I think?) occurs right after
an exception gets caught, all output stops, but processing continues. Google isn't all that
familiar with this problem, so if anyone has any idea, please drop a note. Have fun!

NUWANI 2.0 Release Candidate 1 - JANUARY 1ST, 2009 - PETER BEVERLOO

The first beta contains mainly bug- and performance fixes, next to a minor amount
of (smaller) new features. This might be the second last release before the final,
considering there isn't a lot more planned than beta 2 and beta 3.

- Fixed an invalid parameter bug in the module-prioritization procedure (thanks MrBondt).
- Removed AutoJoin, AutoCommands and QuitMessages from the Bot-core and rewrote them as a module.
- Removed individual parameters, some functions and other things from the Bot-core.
- Updated the ArrayAccess implementation in the Bot-core to include general bot settings.
- Added new module callbacks: onConnect and onDisconnect
- Modules may now return the FINISHED constant, which will stop the callback-loop.
- Removed the "example" module from the package, check the documentation yourself.
- Added various connect-helpers to the Connection module, to handle and fix common problems.
- Nuwani v2.0 is now able to re-connect after being KILL'ed from the server.
- Fixed a potential crash in the Command and Evaluation module when destroying bots.
- Fixed a few minor bugs with the Command module, a wrongly named parameter and its contents.
- Wrote a small Output module which outputs a log to the console.

A special note goes to MrBondt, who reported a bug that wasn't a bug anymore, cheers.

NUWANI 2.0 Beta 3 - JANUARY 1ST, 2009 - PETER BEVERLOO

The third release of Nuwani 2.0, being Release Candidate 3, will most likely
be the last RC before going to a semi-public beta version. This version mainly
includes competability- and bug fixes, next to the security-provider and module
prioritatization. There is a minor loss in performance here though, which will
be solved properly during the beta 1 release.

- Checks whether the runkit module can be used - it's not required anymore.
- Now checks whether a module can be loaded, e.g. the class is available.
- The Module Manager can now properly be used with foreach- and for language constructs.
- Implemented a priority-queue system for modules, based on the configuration (thanks MrBondt).
- Slightly modified implementation of the Memory Manager, still highly expirimental though.
- Implemented an extensive Security Provider system, to be completed for the first beta.
- Created the Commands module, which allows you to create commands like !test
- Fixed a major security flaw with bot-owner verification, it didn't properly check nicks/users/hosts.
- New module callbacks: onModuleLoad, onModuleUnload, onTick and onRaw

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NUWANI 2.0 Beta 2 - DECEMBER 28TH, 2008 - PETER BEVERLOO

This is the second release of the Nuwani 2.0 platform, formally known as RC2.
It includes various new features and enhancements compared from the previous
Release Candidate, and can nearly be considered stable enough to be used in
production environments. Compared to RC1, the following changes have been made.

- Changed NL to PHP_EOL in the Socket class for Windows competability (thanks MrBondt).
- Implemented buffering of the last socket-message to conqueror incompletes (thanks MrBondt).
- Fixed a bug with the evaluation-handler's system-command execution.
- Fixed the line-count for buffered executions in the evaluation-handler (thanks Dennis).
- Fixed automatic-login for the evaluation-handler based on the configuration.
- Implemented an advanced BotGroup featuring method- and property forwarding and an iterator.
- Added "In" to the Bot ArrayAccess-keys, despite it being slower than direct access.
- Added roles for bots, e.g. "master" (active) and "slave" (passive, doesn't handle messages).
- Implemented channel-tracking in the bot's class, also used for bot-matching.
