/**
 * Considering IRC bots generally are long-running, having the ability to set timers which will fire
 * after certain amounts of time certainly is convenient. This class implements that functionality,
 * allowing the bot's core or the modules to execute (public) methods or (anonymous?) functions.
 *
 * There are two primary kinds of timers which we will be handling. The first kind, "timeouts", are
 * functions which will be invoked only once after either a certain amount of time defined in
 * milliseconds, or at a certain time defined by a UNIX timestamp.
 *
 * The second kind of timer are called "intervals", and, as you might be expecting from its name,
 * will be invoked automatically once the interval has passed. At that time the timer will re-set
 * itself, queuing another invocation of the function.
