         *

         * bot must have in order to be matched:
         * * master - A bot must be a master bot, which processes modules.
         * * slave  - A bot must be a slave bot, which is just an extra connection to an IRC server.
         * 
         * Keys can be used using the "key:value" syntax (without quotes). Keywords
         * are just the keywords themselves, without any fancy stuff. All conditionals
         * are to be seperated by spaces.
         * 
         * Examples:
         * "network:GTANet channel:#Nuwani" - Finds all bots in the channel #Nuwani on GTANet.
         * "network:GTANet master" - Finds the master bot on GTANet (note that this doesn't have to be only one bot, but in practise it usually is.)
         * "channel:#Nuwani" - Finds all bots which are in a channel called #Nuwani. Note that this is cross-network.
